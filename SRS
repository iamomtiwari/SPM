Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Pest Detection and Classification System
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Pest Detection and Classification System. This system aims to identify and classify pests from images and provide relevant information to users, such as pest type, potential risks, and recommended actions.

1.2 Scope
The Pest Detection and Classification System is designed to:

Detect pests in images captured by users.
Classify identified pests into predefined categories.
Provide users with information about the detected pests, including possible risks and control measures.
Integrate with a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and reporting.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
Pest: An insect or animal that causes damage to plants, crops, or property.
Classification: The process of categorizing pests into different types based on their characteristics.
API: Application Programming Interface, used for integration with other systems.
ML: Machine Learning, used for pest detection and classification.
